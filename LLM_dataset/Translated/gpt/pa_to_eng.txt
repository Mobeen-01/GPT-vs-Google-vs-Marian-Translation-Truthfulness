According to a comprehensive theory, it not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that cannot usually be rendered by fossilization, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers on the upper side of this animal were reddish-brown in color and pale or carotenoid colored underneath.
This information also provides insight about the wings of birds.
Because the limbs of dinosaurs do not have a fully developed shaft, known as rachis, but they do have other characteristics — barbs and barbules — researchers have speculated that the rachis is a feature that evolved later from these other characteristics.
The structure of the limbs suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for thermal regulation or display. The researcher has suggested that although it may be the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the sample resembles the limb of an adult bird and not the bottom of a boat.
Researchers suggest that although it might be the tail of a small dinosaur, the specimen appears to be the scapula of a large bird and not below the cub.

Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, under heavy supervision by volunteers, votes are counted following specific procedures.

Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, they were readmitted to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Eddie Coyle is still in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court which has charged him with the murder of his son.
She is in custody and waiting for the completion of the indictment and trial process, but the evidence presented as an eyewitness should be considered false because her image had been published everywhere.
In the UK, this might be a common thing, but Scotland’s law operates differently, and the courts consider the publication of photos as potential bias.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee writes, “If journalists publish photographs of suspects, it should be assumed that they are putting their lives on a dangerous path.”
The Crown Office, which is wholly responsible for the prosecution, indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made until at least a legal claim is established.
According to the leak, the document will mention the boundary dispute based on the boundaries that Palestine wanted before the 1967 Middle East war.
According to the news, other issues discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.

In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., eligible volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Executive Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting campaign were provided with extensive security and training instructions.
Mortley administered the oath to a new temporary election council (C.E.P.) of nine members yesterday.
In four years, this is Martelli's fifth CEP.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CP as part of proposals to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was a response to the protests against Martelly's rule that had spread across the world, starting in October.
After 2011, due to several failed attempts to conduct elections, violent protests had started.
Due to overheating, around 60 cases of defects have come to light in several iPods, out of which six caught fire and four people received minor burns from the fire.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan said that it was aware of 27 incidents related to equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company has described as "non-serious".
The ministry called the postponement of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).

In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that no signs of tsunami were found.
A former Filipino police officer has hijacked a bus carrying Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and has taken them hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many prisoners have been released, and so far, six deaths have been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were quickly released because they were photographers from the Philippines.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and built his career in medicine.
He trained in an expert manner and started working in a national women's hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During her work at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in her free time.
In her research, it was found that if a hormone is administered, it will accelerate the development of the fetus's lungs during pregnancy.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna Xtreme was the first queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night with two moons. Beautiful, distinct, just like her. A powerful woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Reynolds commented, "Luna was just as strange to me... perhaps even more... she loves and will remember... I hope she is in a good place."
Before the 2010 federal elections, among the 1,400 people who had opposed the becoming of Australia as a republic in 2008, there was an increase of 8 percent in their number.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
In the poll, 34 percent of people hold the opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the end of the survey, 29% of the respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist, who competed in the 100 meters and 200 meters freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, has always been under scrutiny regarding his health due to his complaints.
He is unable to take medication to alleviate his pain because he has been banned from sports.
Professor Curtis Cooper from the Center for Mathematics, Science, and Computer Science in Central Missouri discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Many people confirmed the discovery by using various hardware and software by the beginning of February, and the announcement was made on Tuesday.
Comets may have carried organic materials, capable of forming proteins and supporting life, as well as being a source that delivered water to Earth.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
53-year-old Cuomo had started his term as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill that legally authorized same-sex marriages.
He dismissed the rumors as "political nonsense and foolishness."
He is expected to become a contender for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to FAA claims, will enable airplanes to fly on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
This utilizes satellite-based technology, which is contrary to the older ground-based technology, and helps air traffic controllers more reliably identify aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
Transfers are not being implemented and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities on the ground are not available.
The fear of lack of transportation increased the possibility of the game being played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A science journal published on Thursday reported about the formation of a new species of birds on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that a new species evolved in just two generations, whereas it is believed that, typically, such a process took a considerably longer time due to the interbreeding between the medium ground finch, Geospiza fortis, and the cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be transformed into every kind of shape. It can be rolled into small sizes.
It can be drawn into thin wires, which can be bent and folded. It can also be hammered into sheets.
It can be made very thin and fitted into other metals. It can be made so thin that it was often used to embellish hand-painted pictures in books known as "illuminated manuscripts."
It is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes based on the level of acidity or alkalinity (alkaline).
The pH level in the tested chemical is represented by the concentration of hydrogen (H in pH) ions.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Mix both the dry powders together and then, with clean wet hands, squeeze them into your hair.
The moisture from your hands will react with the outer layers, which will appear funny and will create a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to an excellent sewage system.
Parts of sewage systems have been found in the Minoan city of Crete and houses in Santorini, Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had bathhouses. During the Roman civilization, bathhouses were often part of public bathing facilities where both men and women used them.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives time in space and immediately sends it back down.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere partially disrupts our light and vision.
To send a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket up to 100 feet tall is needed.
This wheel has made extraordinary changes in the world. The biggest thing it has done for us is to provide us with extremely easy and fast transportation.
It has given us trains, cars, and many other means of transport.
They have other medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to blue bulls and deer-like animals.
In the end, there are many small cats (including domestic free-range cats) that eat a lot of small prey such as insects, mice, squirrels, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of safeguarding, each cat maintains a specific task that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social among cats, which live in large groups known as prides.
Prides are related to one to three adult individuals, along with more than thirty women and are made of cubs.
Women are generally closer to each other, as if they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
"The pride of the lion, packs of wolves and dogs, act in a way similar to lion-like animals (not other larger cats) in nature, and animals that are very deadly for their prey."
An athlete with an excellent body can climb a tree (though not completely), can swim, can jump long distances, and can pull with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is related to the group (genus Panthera) that includes lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four cats can roar.
The roar of a lion is not quite like the full, loud roar of a Bengal tiger, but rather sounds more like a sentence of growling, gritty noises.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are smaller in size than it is.
According to scientists, ocelots chase animals and, by sniffing and inhaling, track them down for hunting (preying) wherever they have gone.
They can see well in the dark due to night vision, and can also move silently. Ocelots blend into the hunting area and catch their prey with a swipe of their paw.
When a small group of individuals (a small population) becomes separated from the main population that they came from (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island where they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment from their previous surroundings.
In this new environment there are different resources and different competitors; therefore, the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to become a strong competitor compared to before.
There has been absolutely no change in the original population; they still need the same transformations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they gradually start to appear less similar to the other population.
Ultimately, even after thousands or millions of years, both species will appear so different that they will not be able to be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe in, and they take in carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (i.e., the process of inhaling and exhaling).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is in the form of plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The Mosasaurus was the ultimate predator of its time, so it feared no one other than other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaw had more than 70 extremely sharp teeth, embedded along with an extra set in its palate, meaning that nothing that passed through it could escape.
Indeed, we don't know, but it might have had a barbed tongue. Its diet included small cephalopods, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it could potentially have been a cannibal as well.
It attacked everything that came into the water, even gigantic dinosaurs like T. Rex stood no chance against it.
Although we might be familiar with most of their food, the people of Rome also included strange or extraordinary items in their feasts, which included wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rat called a dormouse.
Another distinction was that where poor people and women would sit on chairs to eat their meals, rich people preferred to gather for feasts where sofas were arranged for seating.
In ancient Roman cuisine, foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries could not be included.
For example, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and nor had any ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The people of Babylon built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the deity.
People used to bring animals and other things to offer sacrifices to the deities, and priests would try to fulfill the needs of the deities through rituals and festivals.
In every temple, there was an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, which were called ziggurats, were built as part of a temple.
The top part of the tower was a special religious place for God.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house was not very important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was spent under the open sky.
The women cooked food in the courtyard; only open counters were visible from the alleyway. Stone was used in the construction of homes.
There was no large forest on the land of Canaan, therefore wood was very expensive.
Greenland was scarcely populated. According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland due to murder charges, and he found a lush area in the remote southern regions, which he named Greenland.
Even if we don't pay attention to this research, we still know that the Eskimo community was already living there at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences in the people, states, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have watched the National Treasure movie, you might think that the map of the treasure was written on the back side of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The text on the back of the Declaration of Independence read "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." This text was written upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows whose writing it is, one thing is known, that at the beginning of its lifetime, this huge bureaucratic document (which measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the cipher script was included in the form of a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated the northern regions of France, but the southern regions were still not free.
"Vichy" France had governed this. They were the French people who had made a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940 and worked with their attackers instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied powers attacked southern France, and the attack was called "Operation Dragon."
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces liberated Southern France and then turned their faces towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, and is maintained by society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin 'civilitas' which means 'civil', related to the Latin 'civis', meaning citizen and citizenship, signifying the city or city-state and it defines the shape of any type of society.
City-states are the pioneers of a nation. A culture indicates knowledge across many generations, a long-standing heritage, and good dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any concrete historical evidence and fail to be recognized as complete civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states together formed a weak central government - under the provisions of the Confederation - in which Congress was the mainstay.
Congress was weak in imposing any kind of taxes and, since there was no national executive or judiciary, it had to rely on state officials to implement all its acts, who were often uncooperative.
He did not have the authority to override the tax laws and rates among the kings either.
The accounts needed unanimous consent from all states before any amendments could be made, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The national football team of Italy, along with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Famous sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more popular in northern regions, where Italian people participate in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (of which the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island nation in the world!
Due to the presence of a group of islands in Japan, Japan is geographically referred to as an "archipelago."
Taiwan's origins date back well before the 15th century, where European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, where they initiated changes in the indigenous agricultural practices and employed Chinese laborers to work in the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) established control over the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Dynasty.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures, which are Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists can understand how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and this restoration continues today.
For example, the portrait picture is the most commonly used format in photography, 35mm, which was the dominant reel size at the end of the era of analog reels.
It is still made today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is maintained by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusing, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
Therefore, the ratio of this format (to obtain the simplest form of a whole number by division with twelve) is called 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) are square or approximately near that aspect ratio.
The third is a very rude and often ridiculed standard directive that creates dynamism in a picture while considering the order of magnitude.
It shows that the most important place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church was investigated, which was a royal and powerful church.
For nearly a thousand years, Christianity kept the European states united despite their differences in language and customs.
Its omnipotent power influenced everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the main Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the financial funds of the church are specifically for that purpose.
The church's central authority has been in Rome for almost a thousand years, and the centralization of power and money has forced many people to question whether this is theoretically right.
As soon as the conflict erupted, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
Stopping essential military and public supplies proved to be an effective strategy, although this blockade violated generally accepted international laws, which have been regulated by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain placed explosives to prevent any ship from entering any part of the sea, which also endangered neutral ships.
Because this strategy received a limited response, Germany expected a similar response for its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most people and nations was one of peace and isolation.
After witnessing the horrific events and atrocities during World War I, nations want to avoid such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to America to take up a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the U.S. with his last 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job).
In ancient China, there was a unique way of representing different epochs; each stage or each family that held power was a specific dynasty.
Besides this, each dynasty had unstable timeframes for its divided provinces. Among these, the most famous period is the era of three capitals that occurred over 60 years within the dynasty.
During these times, a terrible war occurred between several families fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, where thousands of people fought and died to sit on the highest throne of the magnificent palace in Xi'an.
Many social and political influences such as the use of the metric system, changing from authoritarianism to democracy, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs not to a single ruler but to all the people.
After the revolution, opportunities opened up for innovators among whom the most enthusiastic and successful individuals emerged.
This applies to the military as well, as the military's ranking system had shifted from being class-based to being based on competence.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their revolutions.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond this worldly life. He would often go to a cave located on the mountain called "Noor" (Light), known as "Hira" for contemplation.
He made it himself, which remained so for a long time, providing a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
In the northern mountains of Mecca, a cave located on the summit of a mountain is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, despite knowing of its existence, finding it is not at all easy. Once inside the cave, it is completely isolated.
Above a clear beautiful sky and apart from many nearby mountains, nothing else can be seen. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from within a cave.
Among the Seven Wonders, only the Great Pyramid at Giza still exists in good condition today.
The Great Pyramid is one of the several large pyramid structures built by the Egyptians in the third century BC in honor of the deceased Pharaoh.
In the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, the Giza Plateau, also known as the "Giza Necropolis," contains several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The symbol for "increasing the gas" is like a V, and the symbol for "decreasing the gas" is like a square without any staple or bottom line.
The meaning of "up" is that you need to start from the end and push the measuring tape, and the meaning of "down" is that you need to pull by placing the side of the tape (where the tape is held) on the line.
An up-bow generally produces a soft sound, whereas a down-bow is stronger and more forceful.
Make the pencil feel free in your own targets, but remember that the printed Boeing marks are here due to musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
Terrifying King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth were forced by a crowd of market women on 6 October 1789 to return to Paris from Versailles.
In a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting abuses and threats against the king and queen, they returned to Paris.
The crowd forced the king and queen to fully open the windows of their carriage.
One time, a member of the crowd knocked off the head of a royal guard in front of the terrified queen at Versailles.
The war expenses incurred by the imperialism of the United States with the aim of ruling over the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They forced the American colonial administration to pay taxes for the payment of costs and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Indeed, the significant benefits derived from the long-standing exploitation of Filipino people will form the basis of the fundamental profits of United States imperialism.
To understand the Templar, it is necessary for a person to understand the context behind issuing an order.
The era in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300) of European history.
Before the High Middle Ages, there came the Early Middle Ages, and after this came the Late Middle Ages, which ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, which includes thoughts based on existing technology or efforts made for essential techniques, and it involves a clear understanding that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their application in technology.
Technological determinism shares two common ideas: that the development of technology follows a path independent of cultural or political influence, and in turn, technology "impacts" those societies that are inherently conditioned rather than socially conditional.
For example, one could say that motorcars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
Although it is not economically feasible to develop road networks throughout the country just for a few cars, new methods of production are developed to reduce the prices of cars.
The increase in car purchases leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which necessitates the development of new techniques for treating injured bodies in the healthcare sector.
The excitement involved a significant role of cultural determinism received from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography influenced individuals and the customs and cultures that emerged from that geography adapted over time and to the level of society, making them better than arbitrarily enforced laws.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was called the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was renowned as the epicenter of luxury from about 400 AD to approximately 1100 AD.
Its status during the twelfth century was predominantly rejected due to the fact that the Crusaders returned gifts like silk and spices because they were more valuable than the offers made by the Byzantine markets.
At this time, the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was in its prime between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, this attire was heavily influenced by the Byzantine civilization in the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, the style in the West could have been 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. As a result of the Crusades, the most significant development was that people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is the type of farming that is done to produce a sufficient amount of food to meet only the needs of a farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming involves using crop rotation or other conventional techniques, along with using saved seeds from the specific region, to increase production in a system that is generally organic and straightforward.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together people with similar ideologies who feel excluded by societal standards and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
