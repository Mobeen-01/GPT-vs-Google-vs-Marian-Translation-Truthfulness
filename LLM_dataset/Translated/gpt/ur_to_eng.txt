This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, but it also provides details that fossils typically cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage (feathers) of this animal was chestnut brown with a yellowish tint on top or had a carotenoid color underneath.
This research also provides an understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, known as the rachis, they nonetheless possessed other features of the feather - barbs and barbules - leading researchers to conclude that the development of the rachis might have evolved later along with other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for thermoregulation or display. Researchers have proposed that although this is a tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and does not display the fine downy feathers of a chick.

Since being accused of murdering his son, Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She will remain in custody pending charges and trial, but any direct evidence will be compromised because her image has been widely published.
This might be common practice somewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have considered the publication of pictures potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University stated, "Journalists who publish photos of suspects are walking a dangerous line."
The Crown Office, which oversees all proceedings, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made until at least charges are filed.
According to this leak, this document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine needs based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
According to the report, other covered topics include the future status of Jerusalem, which is respectable for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.

Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) the other day.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission proposed the premature retirement of the CEP as part of the package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
The response of Martelly to the anti-government protests starting in October was a commission.
The failure to hold elections ignited temporary violent demonstrations, with some elections pending since 2011.

Before the 2010 federal election, among the 1400 individuals polled, there was an 8 percent increase in the number of opponents to Australia becoming a republic since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of participants in the poll believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last crowned monarch of Australia.
According to a survey conducted at the two extreme ends of opinion, 29 percent of the respondents believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent thought that Australia should never become a republic.

NextGen is a system that allows airplanes to fly on smaller routes according to FAA's claims, which saves millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduces carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology, which is distinct from the somewhat older, ground-radar-based technology, to enable air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation is available, and the trains running on the surface do not stop at Wembley, and there are no car parking and park and ride facilities on the ground.
Concerns over the lack of transportation facilities have increased the possibility that the game will have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new species of birds on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the process would take longer. This evolution occurred from the breeding between the native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the foreign cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be molded into all kinds of shapes. It can be given the smallest of forms.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can be bent and kneaded. It can be wrapped in sheets and broken.
It can be made extremely thin, and can stick to another metal. It can be made so thin that sometimes it was used to decorate those hand-painted pictures in books known as "illuminated manuscripts."
It is called pH in chemistry. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color change of cabbage juice depends on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The pH level of the tested chemical is represented by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH).
Hydrogen ions are those protons whose electrons separate them (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Knead both dry powders together, and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react against the external surface, creating a tingling sensation and forming a shell-like object.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet, which was connected to a developed sewage system.
Remnants of sewage drainage systems have been found in the houses of Knossos and Santorini in Greece.
Bathhouses existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. "In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of the public bathhouses where men and women would be together.
When you call a person who is a thousand miles away, you use a satellite.
A response is received on the artificial satellite in space, and it immediately sends it down to Earth.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. The Earth's atmosphere distorts our vision and eyesight, which is why scientists use telescopes in space.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a gigantic rocket that is 100 feet tall is required.
Due to the wheel, there has been an amazing change in the world. The greatest invention of the wheel for us is the provision of fast and easy mobility.
He provided us with many means of transportation including trains and cars.
Under them are medium-sized cats whose diet consists of medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to deer and stags.
Ultimately, many small-sized cats, including domestic ones, consume a large number of insects, arachnids, and rodents.
The secret to their success was the concept of the right place, a designated special task for each person which kept them competing with each other.
Among the feline species, the lion exhibits the most social behavior, living in large groups called prides.
A group of lions consists of approximately thirty females and children with one to three associated adult males.
As a large family of women, sisters, and daughters, they usually have a very close relationship with each other.
Prides of lions function much like packs of wolves or dogs, surprisingly, their behaviors are similar to those of lions (but not other big cats), and they are also very lethal for their prey.
An athlete with a good physique, the cheetah can climb (not very well), can swim, can jump a good distance, and can pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The cheetah, lion, leopard, and jaguar are part of the genus Panthera. These four are the cats that can roar.
The roar of a cheetah is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more akin to words yelled in irritation.
You know, the cheetah likes to eat small animals. It will hunt monkeys, snakes, mice, and, if it can, birds. The animals the cheetah hunts are considerably smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that cheetahs in the plains track prey and search for animals by sniffing based on smell and the places they inhabit.
They can see well in the dark through night vision and move forward silently. The field cheetah blends with its surroundings to attack and capture its prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from a large population (such as if they move across a mountain barrier or a river, or if they move to a new island and then cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment compared to the past.
There are different types of resources and different competitors in the new environment. Therefore, the population will need different types of features or adaptations for the purpose of intense competition compared to those they previously needed.
No change has occurred in the original population; they still need the same adaptation as before.
As time passes, as the new population adapts to its new environment, they gradually begin to look less like the other population.
In the end, after thousands or perhaps millions of years, these two populations will appear so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants release oxygen, which humans breathe in, and they absorb the carbon dioxide exhaled (released through breathing) by humans.
Plants make their own food through photosynthesis in the sunlight. They also provide shade.
We build our homes with plants and make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is made from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mozazrus was the biggest predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anyone other than other Mozazruses.
Its long jaws were lined with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and along with this, there was an additional row of teeth on the roof of its mouth. This means that nothing that comes in its path can escape from it.
We certainly do not know, but it might have a pointed tongue. Its diet includes turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it could even be a peculiar animal.
"Everything that entered the water came under its attack, even a large dinosaur like the T-Rex could not match it."
While the Romans' food is familiar to us, their feasts also included some strange items such as wild boar, peacock, on skewers, and dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich preferred to arrange feasts where they could lie down on their sides while eating.
The foods that arrived in Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries could not have been included on the tables of ancient Greece.
For example, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, nor had any ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The residents of Babylon had established a primary place of worship for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
People used to bring sacrifices to God, and the priests tried to present God's requirements during ceremonies and festivals ((Na'udhu Billah - We seek refuge in God)).
Every temple has an open courtyard, and within it is a sanctuary that only the priest can enter.
Sometimes, towers with a special pyramidal shape, known as ziggurats, were constructed as part of temples.
The top part of the minaret was a special and sacred place for God.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, homes were not so important.
Most Christian families used to live in the open air.
In the back section, the women used to cook. The store had an open counter facing towards the street. The houses were constructed with stones.
There was no large forest in the land of Canaan, therefore wood was very expensive.
The population in Greenland was very low. In the Norse sagas, they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for the crime of murder, traveled further west, found green pastures, and named it Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already settled there at that time.
Although every country is 'Scandinavian' in its own place, there are numerous differences among the people, authorities, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not correct. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words written behind the Declaration of Independence were "The original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text appears at the bottom and top part of the document.
When it was not clearly known who had written it, it was known that in the early part of his life, a large leather document (which was 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) used to be rolled up for upper storage.
It is possible that the symbol was merely included as a label.
As a result of the D-Day landings and the subsequent battles, the northern region of France was liberated, but its southern part was still not free.
It was governed by the "Vichy" French (the puppet government of France). These were French people who had made peace with Germany in 1940 and instead of fighting the invaders, collaborated with them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces launched an attack on southern France, which was named "Operation Dragon."
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is the unique culture that is collectively adopted by a specific group of individuals who live and work together in a cooperative manner, a society.
The word "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis," which means pertaining to an individual in a private capacity, related to the Latin word "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," which denotes a city or a city-state, and in some way, it also explains the size of a society.
Cities-states are the news bearers of the country. A cultural civilization means transmitting knowledge and arts across generations, establishing a lasting cultural mark, and its proper propagation.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving adequate historical evidence and fail to be recognized as complete civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government initially under the Articles of Confederation, which was their sole component, with Congress.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who often did not cooperate in enforcing all its laws.
It also had no authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The consensus of the states was required for the amendment of these instalments, but the states were so lightly absent from the central government.
The national football team of Italy is the second most successful team in the world along with Germany's national football team, and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more popular in northern regions and Italian people participate in international sports and Olympic competitions.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (with the largest being Honshu), which makes it the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to having a collection/group of islands, Japan is called "Archipelago" in geographical terms.
Taiwan began in the 15th century, where passing European sailors recorded the name of this island as Ilha Formosa, meaning the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiated changes in the methods of native grain production, and employed Chinese laborers in their rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and eastern coastal regions of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Dynasty.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, whereby it recognized the cession of Taiwan to Japan, which then governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three human-made structures, including the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Often, buildings on the edges of this complex have been reconstructed so that tourists can properly understand what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this date.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the most popular film size until the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but the most important thing is that its aspect ratio comes from digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format originally has dimensions that create some degree of variability, measuring 36mm in width by 24mm in height.
It is said that the aspect ratio of this shape (to get the simplest overall number ratio by dividing by twelve) is 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal to or approximately close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often increasingly criticized and disparaged, acts as the sole guideline in an image for maintaining order while creating movement.
It states that the most effective location of the main subject is the intersection of lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally.
During this era of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become very wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, despite having different languages and traditions, the Christian religion kept the European states united under one thread.
All these dominant powers influenced everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the firm beliefs in Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate misery and poverty, and that financial funds of the church are especially there for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth prompted many people to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
This strategy proved effective, resulting in the disruption of both military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated the generally accepted principles of international law that had been established through international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain has laid mines throughout international waters to prevent any ship from entering all parts of the sea, thus putting neutral ships also at risk.
Since the response to this tactic was very limited, Germany expected that there would be the same reaction to unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the predominant attitude of most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrific and barbaric events of the Great War, nations desired to avoid such circumstances in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the city of New York and started working with the Edison Company.
Upon his arrival in America, he had 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his manager in a previous job) for Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of representing different eras; each period or dynasty that ruled was a distinguished royal household.
There was also a turbulent period of divided provinces among every family. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which continued for 60 years between the Jia Han and Jin families.
In those times, severe wars were fought among many princes and nobles for the throne and crown.
In the history of ancient China, the Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest periods. Thousands of people died in this battle to sit in the highest seat in the great palace in Xian.
There are many social and political impacts such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to democracy, nationalism, and the transition towards the belief that the country belongs to the common people, not just one ruler.
After the revolution, all crafts were opened for male applicants, giving extremely hopeful and successful individuals the opportunity to achieve success.
The same thing applies to the army because now, instead of being based on class, the ranking in the army is based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired the oppressed working classes of other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad took a deep interest in matters beyond this worldly life. He often used to go to a cave in the mountain "Noor" (Light) for contemplation and reflection, which became famous as "Hira."
They confined themselves in a cave, which spans periods, presenting a very vivid picture of the spiritual sensations of Muhammad ﷺ.
This cave, located at the peak of the mountain north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find it despite someone knowing of its existence; once you enter the cave, there is complete isolation there.
Above was a clear, beautiful sky and nothing could be seen except many surrounding mountains. Very little could be seen or heard about this world from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only wonder among the seven wonders that still exists in its place today.
The great pyramid built in the third century BC by the Egyptians is one of many large pyramid buildings constructed in honor of the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, located in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, or the "Giza Necropolis," includes several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The up bow mark looks like the letter V, and the "down bow mark" looks like a staple or a square with the bottom side missing.
It means that you start from the tip and press down on the "dakhsh" and going down means you should start from the "medak" (where your hand is holding the "dakhsh") and pull the "dakhsh".
The upper register generally produces a soft sound, whereas the lower register is stronger and more assertive.
Use the pencil freely within your marks, but remember that the hidden grace notes are there because of the music. Hence, they should be respected.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis Charles), along with the king's sister Madame Elizabeth, were forced by a crowd of market women to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
When they returned to Paris in a carriage, they were surrounded by a crowd that was shouting slogans against the king and the queen and threatening them.
The crowd forced the king and queen to fully open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, a member from the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in front of the terrified queen at Versailles.
In the conquest of the Philippines, the war expenses of American imperialism were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They used to pay taxes to the government of the United States for the purpose of paying the interest on bonds issued by Wall Street banks in the name of the large portion and the Philippine government.
In fact, the high interests obtained through the long-term exploitation of Filipino people will shape the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
"To understand the Templars, it is essential to understand the context that prompted the creation of this system."
The era in which these events took place is generally referred to as the medieval period in European history, covering the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
After the Early Middle Ages came the High Middle Ages and then the Late Middle Ages, which collectively ended around 1500.
The theory of technological determinism is a term that encompasses many theories ranging from the advancement towards or the inevitability of modern technology to that strong sense which includes the idea that human destiny is governed by a fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common theories: that the development of technology follows a path that is above civilizational or political influence, and in turn, technology imposes effects on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the automobile essentially paves the way for road development.
However, laying out a network of roads across the country for just a few vehicles is not economically beneficial, hence new methods of production have been developed to reduce the cost of vehicle ownership.
Widespread car ownership also leads to a high rate of accidents on the roads, which results in the development of new techniques in the health sector to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism involves a significant element of cultural determination, which is derived from writers such as Goethe, Gottlieb Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, the traditions and culture associated with that geography, which were in harmony with the place of society, were better than the prescriptive laws imposed.
Just as Paris is known as a fashion hub in the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion center of feudal Europe.
It was known as a center of luxury and pleasure around 400 AD and lasted until the 1100 AD.
In the twelfth century, the primary reason for its decline was that the Crusaders had returned with gifts like silk and spices, the value of which exceeded the prices offered in the Byzantine markets.
This was the time when the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished during the period between the 10th and the 11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, the clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slow communication system, the style of the West could be 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advancements of that time was popularizing the use of buttons to fasten the clothing of crusaders.
Subsistence farming is the type of agriculture that is undertaken solely to provide food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Sustainable agriculture is simple, often organic, maximizing production through crop rotation or other relatively simple methods, in conjunction with using locally conserved seeds of the ecological system.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in agriculture for their livelihood, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal norms and enable them to develop a sense of their own identity.
